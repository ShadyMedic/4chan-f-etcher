These Flashes were scraped from 4chan upload board /f/ using my website 4csc.g6.cz

Each folder contains a .SWF file containing the submitted flash and a .TXT file containing some basic metadata that could be scraped with it.
You can use the metadata to make your curation more complete, but please, keep in mind that 4chan users often don't fill the fields in the submit form seriously.
NOTE: The "Source" metadata is flawer - it doesn't contain the domain. To get the correct version, add "boards.4chan.org/f/" after "https://" - for example turn "https://thread/3468801" into "https://boards.4chan.org/f/thread/3468801"

All of these flashes were tested and none of them CAN'T BE PLAYED IN VLC.
But of course, feel free to double-check that.
